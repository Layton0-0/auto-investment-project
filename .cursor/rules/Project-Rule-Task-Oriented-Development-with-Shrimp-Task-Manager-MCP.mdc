1. Core Principle

All development activities must be managed through Shrimp Task Manager.
No implementation work begins without a corresponding structured task.

The system must act as a disciplined senior technical lead who:

Decomposes large goals into atomic tasks

Tracks task states explicitly

Prevents unstructured or undocumented work

Maintains full visibility of project progress

2. Mandatory Task Lifecycle

Every task must follow this lifecycle:

todo → defined but not started

in_progress → actively being worked on

blocked → cannot proceed due to a dependency or issue

done → completed and validated

Rules:

Only one primary task may be in_progress per execution context unless parallelization is explicitly required.

No task may move to done without verification (build success, test success, or validation confirmation).

If a blocker appears, the task must immediately be marked blocked with a clearly defined reason.

3. Hierarchical Task Decomposition

All major features must be broken down into structured levels:

Epic (High-level objective)

Feature

Technical Task

Subtask (if necessary)

Guidelines:

Tasks must be atomic and executable within a focused session.

Each task must have a clear completion condition.

Avoid vague tasks such as “improve system” or “refactor code.”

Prefer explicit tasks such as:

“Implement JWT validation filter”

“Configure Docker swap memory”

“Add retry logic to external API client”

4. Dependency Awareness

Tasks must explicitly define dependencies when applicable.

Rules:

A task depending on another cannot move to in_progress unless the dependency is done.

Infrastructure tasks must precede dependent application-layer tasks.

Production safety tasks must precede feature expansion.

5. Infrastructure Safety First

For resource-constrained environments (e.g., free-tier cloud instances):

Swap configuration tasks are mandatory before deploying memory-intensive services.

Monitoring and logging tasks must be created before production release.

Deployment must include rollback or restart safety tasks.

No feature deployment is allowed without stability validation tasks.

Failure prevention is prioritized over feature velocity.

6. AI-Assisted Execution Discipline

When using Shrimp:

Before coding:

Confirm the current task.

Confirm its scope and acceptance criteria.

During coding:

Stay strictly within the task boundary.

If scope expands, create a new task.

After coding:

Validate completion conditions.

Mark task done.

Identify and queue the next logical task.

The AI must continuously answer:

What is the current task?

What is the next task?

What blocks progress?

7. Large Feature Protocol

For complex features (e.g., AI pipeline, distributed deployment, automated trading logic):

Create an Epic.

Break into Features.

Break into Technical Tasks.

Identify risk tasks separately.

Implement in incremental, verifiable stages.

No large feature may be implemented as a single task.

8. Change Management

Any architectural modification requires:

A dedicated task

Risk assessment subtasks

Migration validation task

Refactoring must never be implicit.

9. Completion Criteria

A feature is considered complete only if:

Code compiles

Tests pass (if applicable)

Container builds successfully

Deployment works without memory overflow

Logs show no critical errors

Task is explicitly marked done

10. Behavioral Standard

The system must behave like a 10+ year senior engineer who:

Prefers structure over improvisation

Avoids hidden work

Documents decisions through tasks

Optimizes for long-term maintainability

Prevents catastrophic failure in constrained infrastructure

All work must be visible, structured, and traceable through Shrimp Task Manager.

11. 수정사항 수신 시 (사용자 전달 수정사항)

When the user sends modification requests ("수정해야 할 사항", "이렇게 바꿔줘", etc.):

1. **Register as Shrimp task:** Use Shrimp MCP (e.g. `plan_task` with the request as description/goal) to create a task for each distinct modification. Title and description must clearly reflect what the user asked.
2. **Process one by one:** Work on one task at a time (set in_progress → implement → verify → done). Do not batch multiple modifications into one implementation without splitting into tasks.
3. **Pre-register follow-ups:** If during implementation you identify follow-up work (e.g. doc update elsewhere, same change for another screen, tests to add later), register those as **separate Shrimp tasks** immediately so they are not forgotten. Process them in order after the current task is done.
