1. Philosophy & First Principles

Capital preservation precedes profit generation. Any strategy that cannot explicitly control downside risk is invalid.

Every model is wrong; robustness is non-negotiable. Strategies must survive regime shifts, tail events, and data imperfections.

Simplicity beats elegance. If a strategy cannot be explained clearly, it is not production-ready.

Automation without observability is malpractice. No black-box execution is allowed.

2. Strategy Design Rules

Strategies must be hypothesis-driven, not data-mined.

Each strategy must clearly define:

Market inefficiency exploited

Time horizon (holding period)

Source of edge (statistical, behavioral, structural)

Avoid single-factor dependency. Prefer orthogonal signal combinations.

Strategy logic must be deterministic and reproducible.

3. Data Integrity & Handling

Assume all external data is flawed unless proven otherwise.

Enforce:

Point-in-time correctness

Survivorship bias elimination

Corporate action normalization

Never reuse backtest-cleaned data in live trading.

All data transformations must be idempotent and auditable.

4. Backtesting & Validation

Backtests must include:

Transaction costs

Slippage

Latency assumptions

No strategy is valid without:

Out-of-sample testing

Walk-forward analysis

Stress testing under extreme scenarios

Reject any result with suspiciously smooth equity curves.

Statistical significance > visual appeal.

5. Risk Management (Non-Negotiable)

Risk is managed at portfolio level first, strategy level second.

Mandatory controls:

Max drawdown limits

Volatility targeting

Position sizing via risk, not conviction

No strategy may exceed predefined:

Exposure limits

Leverage thresholds

Kill-switch logic is required for all automated execution.

6. Execution & Trading Infrastructure

Separate concerns strictly:

Signal generation

Risk checks

Order execution

Execution must be:

Idempotent

Retry-safe

Fail-fast on inconsistencies

Never assume broker/API reliability.

Execution latency assumptions must be explicitly documented.

7. Code Quality & Engineering Discipline

Production trading code is financial infrastructure, not experimental scripts.

Enforce:

Strong typing

Explicit state management

Immutable strategy parameters

No hidden magic numbers.

Configuration must be externalized and version-controlled.

Every critical component must have:

Unit tests

Integration tests

Simulation tests

8. Observability & Monitoring

Real-time monitoring is mandatory for:

PnL

Exposure

Order state

Risk metrics

Alerts must be:

Actionable

Minimal

Noise-free

If a system cannot explain why it traded, it is considered broken.

9. Change Management & Deployment

Strategy changes require:

Version bump

Full backtest rerun

Explicit rationale documentation

Hot-fixes in production are strongly discouraged.

Rollbacks must be instantaneous and safe.

No unreviewed code reaches live capital.

10. Governance & Professional Discipline

Ego has no place in quantitative trading.

Losses are analyzed, not rationalized.

Performance attribution is mandatory.

If a strategy stops making sense, it stops trading—immediately.

11. Ethical & Market Responsibility

Do not design strategies that:

Intentionally manipulate markets

Exploit illegal information

Compliance constraints are design inputs, not afterthoughts.

Assume everything will be audited eventually.

12. Final Rule

A quant system exists to survive first, compound second.
If it cannot survive without human intervention, it does not deserve capital.
